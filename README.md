[NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/) that allows to use every part of VSCode, including the monaco editor

## Installation

```bash
npm install vscode@npm:@codingame/monaco-vscode-api
npm install monaco-editor@npm:@codingame/monaco-vscode-editor-api
npm install -D @types/vscode
```

`@codingame/monaco-vscode-api` is installed as an alias to `vscode` to be able to run `import * as vscode from 'vscode'`, similar to what is done inside a VSCode extension

`@codingame/monaco-vscode-editor-api` is installed as an alias to `monaco-editor` because it provides the same api as the official `monaco-editor`

## Troubleshooting

### `process` node builtin

Since v1.86, VSCode detects its running environment by checking if a global variable `process` exists.
For backward compatibility reasons or to be able to use node libraries in the browser, bundlers can be configured to inject a polyfill for it.
Doing so may create unexpected behaviors and crashes.

Make sure `typeof process === 'undefined'` returns true when using this library.

### If you use Webpack

Starting from v2, [monaco-editor-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin) can't be used

Here's the alternative for each options:
- `filename`: it can be configured at the webpack level directly
- `publicPath`: it can be configured at the webpack level or by hands when redistering the worker in `window.MonacoEnvironment`.
- `languages`: Monaco languages cannot be used anyway. Import vscode language extensions instead (`@codingame/monaco-vscode-xxx-default-extension`).
- `features`: With this lib, you can't remove editor features.
- `globalAPI`: you can set `window.MonacoEnvironment.globalAPI` to true

### If you use Vite

This library uses a lot the `new URL('asset.extension', import.meta.url)` syntax which [is supported by vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#new-url-url-import-meta-url)

While it works great in `build` mode (because rollup is used), there is some issues in `watch` mode:
- import.meta.url is not replaced while creating bundles, it is an issue when the syntax is used inside a dependency
- vite is still trying to inject/transform javascript assets files, breaking the code by injecting ESM imports in commonjs files

There are workarounds for both:

- We can help vite by replacing `import.meta.url` by the original module path:
```typescript
import importMetaUrlPlugin from '@codingame/esbuild-import-meta-url-plugin'

{
  ...
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      plugins: [importMetaUrlPlugin]
    }
  }
}
```

### If using Angular and getting `Not allowed to load local resource:` errors

*The short version*: set up and use a custom webpack config file and add this under `module`:
```typescript
parser: {
  javascript: {
    url: true,
  },
},
```

# Usage

## Monaco standalone services

`monaco-editor`, as well as this library by default, uses `standalone` version or the vscode services, which are much simpler than the one used in VSCode.

You may want to provide your custom implementations of them. To do so, you can use the `initialize` method from `vscode/services`.
Also, monaco-editor doesn't provide types for them, so this library exports them.

Example:

```typescript
import { INotificationService, initialize } from 'vscode/services'

class MyCustomNotificationService implements INotificationService { ... }
await initialize({
  get [INotificationService.toString()] () {
    return new MyCustomNotificationService(...)
  }
})
```

Additionally, several packages that include the VSCode version of some services (with some glue to make it work with monaco) are published:

- **Base** (included by default): `@codingame/monaco-vscode-base-service-override`
  - Contains some general-use services that are mandatory to most of the other features
- **Host** (included by default): `@codingame/monaco-vscode-host-service-override`
  - Interaction with the host/browser (shutdown veto, focus/active management, window opening, fullscreen...)
- **Extensions** (included by default): `@codingame/monaco-vscode-extensions-service-override`
  - Support for VSCode extensions.
  - A worker configuration can be provided to it:
    - Then, extensions run in a worker which runs in an iframe, with all the implications (can be created by the bundler directly). The worker script is expected to be hosted on a separate domain.
- **Files** (included by default): `@codingame/monaco-vscode-files-service-override`
  - It adds the overlay filesystem for `file://` files, but also adds the support for lazy loaded extension files. It adds separate memory user files (e.g. config, keybindings), cache files and log files.
  - It supports adding overlay filesystems for `file://` files
- **QuickAccess** (included by default): `@codingame/monaco-vscode-quickaccess-service-override`
  - Enables the quickaccess menu in the editor (press F1 or ctrl+shift+p)
- **Notifications**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-notifications-service-override`
  - This services enables vscode notifications you usually find in the bottom right corner.
- **Dialogs**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-dialogs-service-override`
  - Enable vscode modal dialogs. It allows users to select an action to do. Those actions are exposed to the vscode API. Additionally, this service can be used by the language client to delegate questions to the user.
- **Model**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-model-service-override`
  - This service creates and takes care of model references. For example:
    - Create model from filesystem if content is unknown
    - Count references
    - Destroy models when they are no longer used
- **Editor**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-editor-service-override`
  - Enable editor support. This is usually needed when working with the language server protocol. Without enabling the editor service, it will only be able to resolve the currently open model (only internal file links will work).
- **Views**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-views-service-override`
  - Enable full views support. Is exclusive with the `editor` service. Do not use both services at the same time.
- **Configuration**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-configuration-service-override`
  - Allows to change the configuration of not only the editors, but every part of vscode. The language client for instance uses it to send the requested configuration to the server. The default configuration service already allows to change the configuration. This service overrides makes it rely on a user configuration file (with json schema, overridable by language including all vscode features).
- **Keybindings**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-keybindings-service-override`
  - Enables platform specific keybindings and make it rely on a user definded keybindings configuration (if available).
- **Languages**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-languages-service-override`
  - Enable language support. It's like the standalone service with 2 differences:
    - It handle the language extension point (getting languages from vscode extensions)
    - It triggers the `onLanguage:${language}` event (to load vscode extension listening to those events)
- **Textmate**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-textmate-service-override`
  - Allows to use textmate grammars. Depends on *themes* service. vscode extensions use textmate grammars exclusively for highlighting. Once this is enabled monarch grammars can no longer be loaded by monaco-editor.
- **Themes**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-theme-service-override`
  - Allows to use VSCode themes.
- **Snippets**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-snippets-service-override`
  - Add snippet extension point (register vscode extension snippets)
- **Audio cue**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-audio-cue-service-override`
  - If enabled the editor may provides audible hints
- **Debug**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-debug-service-override`
  - Activate debugging support
- **Preferences**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-preferences-service-override`
  - Allow to read and write preferences
- **Output**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-output-service-override`
  - Output panel support. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Terminal**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-terminal-service-override`
  - Terminal panel support. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Search**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-search-service-override`
  - search panel support. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Markers**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-markers-service-override`
  - It adds the problems panel tab. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **SCM**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-scm-service-override`
  - It adds the SCM API that can be used to implement source control. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Testing**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-testing-service-override`
  - It adds the Tests API. *Hint*: It makes more sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Language detection worker**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-detection-worker-service-override`
  - When opening an untitled model or a file without extension or if vscode is unable to guess the language simply by the file extension or by reading the first line. Then it will use tensorflow in a worker to try to guess the most probable language (here we are only able to rely on the open source model).
- **Storage**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-storage-service-override`
  - Define your own storage or use the default BrowserStorageService. The storage service is used in many places either as a cache or as a user preference store. For instance:
    - Current loaded theme is stored in there to be loaded faster on start.
    - Every panel/view positions are stored in there.
- **LifeCycle**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-lifecycle-service-override`
  - Allow other services to veto a page reload (for instance when not all open files are saved)
- **Remote agent**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-remote-agent-service-override`
  - Connect to a remote vscode agent and have access to:
    - The remote filesystem
    - The remote file search
    - Running terminals
    - Running vscode extensions (not web-compatible)
    - and probably more?

  Another package `@codingame/monaco-vscode-server` is published, which expose a `vscode-ext-host-server` bin to start the remote agent
- **Accessibility**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-accessibility-service-override`
  - Register accessibility helpers
- **Workspace trust**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-workspace-trust-service-override`
  - Ask user it they trust the current workspace, disable some features if not
- **Extension Gallery**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-extension-gallery-service-override`
  - Support for the VSCode marketplace, it allows to install extensions from the marketplace.
- **Chat**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-chat-service-override`
  - Support for chat and inline chat features
- **Notebook**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-notebook-service-override`
  - Support for Jupyter notebooks
- **Welcome**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-welcome-service-override`
  - Support for welcome pages/components. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **User data sync**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-user-data-sync-service-override`
  - Support for user data sync. ⚠️ It can't really be used as it relies on a [closed source backend from microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync#_can-i-use-a-different-backend-or-service-for-settings-sync) for the moment ⚠️
- **Ai**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-ai-service-override`
  - Ai support for the ai extension api (RelatedInformation/EmbeddingVector)
- **Task**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-task-service-override`
  - Task management
- **Outline**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-outline-service-override`
  - Support for the outline view. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Timeline**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-timeline-service-override`
  - Support for the timeline view. *Hint*: It only makes sense to enable it when *Views* service is used.
- **Workbench**: `@codingame/monaco-vscode-workbench-service-override`
  - Allows to render the full workbench layout. Is exclusive with the `views` service. Do not use both services at the same time.

Usage:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode'
import { initialize } from 'vscode/services'
import getEditorServiceOverride from '@codingame/monaco-vscode-editor-service-override'
import getConfigurationServiceOverride, { updateUserConfiguration, configurationRegistry } from '@codingame/monaco-vscode-configuration-service-override'

await initialize({
  ...getModelEditorServiceOverride((model, input, sideBySide) => {
    // Open a new editor here and return it
    // It will be called when for instance the user ctrl+click on an import
  }),
  ...getConfigurationServiceOverride(vscode.Uri.file('/tmp/'))
})

updateUserConfiguration(`{
  "editor.fontSize": 12,
  "[java]": {
    "editor.fontSize": 15,
  }
}`)
```

### Troubleshoot

`initialize` can only be called once ( and it should be called BEFORE creating your first editor).

## Model creation

The official `monaco-editor` package provides a function to create models: `monaco.editor.createModel`.

This method creates a standalone model that cannot be found or used by any VSCode services.

The recommended way is to used the `createModelReference` method instead (added on top of the official monaco-editor api) which returns instead a reference to a model.

It has some pros:
- The model reference can be used by VSCode services, allowing for instance following links between files (ctrl+click)
- The returned model is bound to a filesystem file, and you have access to methods allowing to control the file lifecycle (saving the file, accessing the dirty state...)
- It is possible to call the method multiple times on the same file to get multiple references. The model is disposed when there is no reference left

The second argument of the method allows you to write the file content to the virtual filesystem in case the file wasn't registered in it beforehand.

before:

```typescript
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor'
const model = monaco.editor.createModel(...)
const editor = monaco.editor.create({ model, ... })

...

model.dispose()
editor.dispose()

```

after:

```typescript
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor'

const modelRef = await monaco.editor.createModelReference(...)

const editor = monaco.editor.create({ model: modelRef.object.textEditorModel })

...

await modelRef.object.save()

...

modelRef.dispose()
editor.dispose()


```

`createModelReference` return a reference to a model. The value is fetched from the memory filesystem (which is written if you provide the second argument).
The reference can then be disposed, the model will only be disposed if there is no remaining references.

## VSCode api usage

To be able to use the VSCode api directly from your code, you need to import `vscode/localExtensionHost` and the services to be initialized.

You will then be able to import it as if you were in a VSCode extension:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode'
import 'vscode/localExtensionHost'

const range = new vscode.Range(...)
vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider(...)
```

You can also register a new extension from its manifest:
```typescript
import { registerExtension, initialize, ExtensionHostKind } from 'vscode/extensions'

await initialize()

const { registerFileUrl, getApi } = registerExtension({
  name: 'my-extension',
  publisher: 'someone',
  version: '1.0.0',
  engines: {
      vscode: '*'
  },
  contributes: {
  }
}, ExtensionHostKind.LocalProcess)

registerFileUrl('/file-extension-path.json', new URL('./file-real-path.json', import.meta.url).toString())

const vscode = await getApi()

vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider(...)

```

### Default vscode extensions

VSCode uses a bunch of default extensions. Most of them are used to load the default languages and grammars (see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions).

This library bundles and publishes them and allows to import the ones you want:
```typescript
import '@codingame/monaco-vscode-javascript-default-extension'
import '@codingame/monaco-vscode-json-default-extension'
...
```

### Loading vsix file

VSCode extensions are bundled as vsix files.
This library publishes a rollup plugin (vite-compatible) that allows to load a vsix file.

- rollup/vite config:
```typescript
import vsixPlugin from '@codingame/monaco-vscode-rollup-vsix-plugin'
...
plugins: [
  ...,
  vsixPlugin()
]
```
- code:
```typescript
import './extension.vsix'
```

### Localization

This library also offers the possibility to localize vscode and the extensions in the supported languages. To do so, import one of the following packages before anything else:
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-cs`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-de`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-es`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-fr`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-it`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-ja`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-ko`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-pl`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-pt-br`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-qps-ploc`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-ru`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-tr`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-zh-hans`
- `@codingame/monaco-vscode-language-pack-zh-hant`

⚠️ The language pack should be imported and loaded BEFORE anything else from monaco-editor or this library is loaded. Otherwise, some translations would be missing. ⚠️


### Demo

Try it out on https://codingame.github.io/monaco-vscode-api/

There is a demo that showcases the service-override features. It allows to register contributions with the same syntaxes as in VSCode.
It includes:

- Languages
- VSCode themes
- Textmate grammars (requires vscode themes)
- Notifications/Dialogs
- Model/Editor services
- Configuration service, with user configuration editor
- Keybinding service, with user keybindings editor
- Debuggers
- Remote agent
- and much more

From CLI run:

```bash
# build monaco-vscode-api (the demo use it as a local dependency)
npm ci
npm run build
# start demo
cd demo
npm ci
npm start
# OR: for vite debug output
npm run start:debug
```

For the debug feature, also run:
```bash
npm run start:debugServer
```

⚠️ Building monaco-vscode-api is only supported on Linux or Mac. It you use Windows, have a look at [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) ⚠️

#### Remote agent

To connect to a remote agent, run:
```bash
npm run start:extHostServer
```

Then go to http://localhost:5173/?remoteAuthority=localhost:8000

You can also go to http://localhost:5173/?remoteAuthority=localhost:8000&remotePath=/any/path/on/your/machine to open a directory on your machine as the current workspace

### History

This project was mainly created to make the implementation of [monaco-languageclient](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient) more robust and maintainable.

monaco-languageclient uses [vscode-languageclient](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient) which was built to run inside a VSCode extension. VSCode extensions communicate with the editor via an [API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/vscode) they can import into their code.

[The VSCode api](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) exports:

- Some functions to interact with the IDE ([language feature registrations](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages), [command execution](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands)...)
- A lot of utility classes (Range, Position...)

The first implementations of [monaco-languageclient](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient) were using a fake VSCode api implementation. The vscode-languageclient was hacked so the VSCode<->protocol object converters were mainly bypassed, so the fake VSCode api was receiving [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) objects. Then the objects were transformed using custom transformers into [Monaco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor) objects to communicate with the monaco api.

This approach has some disadvantages:

- There is a lot of code to transform LSP objects into Monaco objects
- It's hard to follow the updates of VSCode and the language server protocol
- It doesn't behave exactly the same as in VSCode

With this library, it would be possible to plug vscode-languageclient directly on top of monaco, monaco-languageclient still helps to do so by:

- Adding some tweaks to the VSCode LanguageClient (Removing unsupported features...)
- Providing some examples on how to build an app using it
- Adding some tools (DisposableCollection)
